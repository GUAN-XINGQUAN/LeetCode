while storing the values and index into a dictionary;
  check if (target-current value) already exists in dictionary;
    if so, return [index of (target-current value), current index]
  otherwise store values and index into dict.


Remarks:
for i, j in enumerate(list):
# i is index and j is associated element

dict.keys()  # keys of dictionary
dict.values()  # values of dictionary
dict[key]  # given a key to find value
