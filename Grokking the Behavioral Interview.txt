Grokking the Behavioral Interview
----------------------------------------
I. Truths about behavior interview
----------------------------------------
1. The Purpose of Behavioral Interviews? What interviewers are really assessing?
- Depends on the culture of the company. 
- Some points they may wonder - 
	- Are you calm under pressure?
	- Are you comfortable giving formal presentations?
	- Can you respectfully give your boss bad news?
	- Your ability to work in teams and collaborate with others?
	- Are you good at knowledge sharing or being a good motivator?
	- They might prioritize self-awareness, growth mindset, ambition, humility, comfort with ambiguity, or risk tolerance.
2. Use the STAR technique to explain your experience. STAR stands for Situation(background), Task(What task? Why task? Your responsibility?), Action(I did instead of we did), and Results(conclusion. Dosen't need to be a happy ending).
3. Be Concise. Get Confirmation. Avoid being absolute. Control the Pace. 
4. Your life might be your resume. In some cases when professional experience is not available, try to find some examples from your non-professional life. The goal of the BQ intervew is to know more about YOURSELF.
5. Some points about answering a prior experience question - 
- Focus on what I did instead of what WE did. 
6. Some points about answering a hypotheticals question - 
- There're 2 important things for such questions - thought process and communication. 
- If you are someone who loves details and accuracy, you will be tempted to ask for specifics before answering. Resist this urge! This is a hypothetical situation, not a real one. If you need specifics, state them as your assumptions. For example, “I will assume that the team is co-located,” or “I will say it’s springtime​ and temperatures outside are moderate.” For more information, check the Google tips here: https://bit.ly/3nvPP5z
- You can take advantage of hypothetical questions to highlight specific skills that you know will be beneficial to the organization (hence why it is important to do your homework!).
- These questions may not necessarily follow the STAR technique because the situation is given and there are no tangible results that you can declare. Instead, restate the situation, be creative with your tasks and actions, and the results will be implied.
7. Your turn: how to ask questions. 
- Always prepare one.
- If you found a new one during the interview, use this one. 
- The best method is to ask your interviewer questions that give them a chance to talk about themselves.
- Ask open-ended questions that elicit a response beyond “yes” or “no.”
- If you found that the interviewer is ending the interview, do not ask. Send these questions to your recruiters.
- Ask questions that are in the same context as the behavioral interview.



II. Some questions to ask before a behavioral interview
----------------------------------------
1. What is the goal of that company? Does this goal facinating? Is there any overlapping between this one and your own?
2. What's the tag/signal that the company with to deliver to the public?
3. What's the main points required by the job description? (besides of tech)
4. What questions do I want to ask the company in person?



III. Different types of interviews
----------------------------------------
1. Culture Interview. Ususally carried out with an recruiter. It usually starts with a self-introduction. Education background, skills, previous professional experience, expectations for future career will help to form what kind of person you are. Try to impress his or her!
2. Phone interview. There're some techniques/tricks for phone interviews, including doing research at the company, selecting morning timeslots, listening and then talking. You can send a follow-up letter if needed. This note should be short and restate your interest, your confidence that you can do the job, and a question about next steps.
3. On-site interview. In this section, body language is important. Try to open your body up, lean-in to the conversation, and mirror your interviewer(aka do what he/she does, which will reinforces your human connection). If it is a virtual on-site interview, prepare your cam ahead of time. 
4. Not an exact match? No problem! Try to make yourself likable, and show-off your advantages and how will you overcome the points that make you dismatched. 
5. Rejection is normal. Sometimes, it's not your fault, and this job is not the only job in existence.
